### Project Overview
Finish the Lyrics is a web app that will allow the user to sing along to some of the most popular karaoke songs. This app is for anyone looking to test our their lyric skills. A clue of partial lyrics will display on the page along with three text inputs. The user will have the ability to enter and submit the final three words to the lyrics. Upon clicking the 'Submit' button or pushing the return key, the user-input lyrics will be checked against the true lyrics and a "Correct!" or "Incorrect!" will display on the screen. Finish The Lyrics has 3 rounds of 5 songs with increasing difficulty. There is also a score calculated for each round with one point for each correct answer. After the final game completion or between rounds, there is an option go navigate to the "Feeling Inspired" page. If the user is feeling inspired by singing along to the songs, they can enter a location and find the nearest karaoke bars. 

### Technology
Finish the Lyrics is powered by MusixMatch. The MusixMatch API was used to display lyrics for the most popular karaoke songs. The "Feeling Inspired" feature is powered by the Yelp and Google Maps API. The technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. 


### Workflow
For this project, I had my first experience with the Agile methodology. I utilized Pivotal Tracker to track user stories and assigned a partner as the owner of my stories to complete the final acceptance. My workflow also incorported iniital wireframes for the layout and a feature branch was utilized when adding on the additional yelp/google maps feature.
